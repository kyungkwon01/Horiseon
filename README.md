About The Project

For this project, I was provided with the starter code and modified it to achieve user story.

The goal of this project is to refactor the existing code to meet certain set of standards and implement new technology to make the site more accessible.

It is important to ensure people with disabilities can assess a website with assistive technology like video captions, screen reader, and braille keyboards.

I have implemented semantic elements and alt-text to images so the website can be more accessible. Also, CSS selectors and properties were updated to follow semantic structure, along with removing duplicate declaration blocks with identical properties.
